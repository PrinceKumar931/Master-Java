//divide-and-conquer.
//in-space.
//Quicksort works by dividing a large array into smaller arrays and then sorting those smaller arrays.
// A pivot element is used to partition a large array into smaller arrays.
// smaller arrays are divided recursively until an array with only one or no elements is created.


//time complexity: Worst Case= O(n^2), Best Case, Average Case=O(n log n).

/* Quicksort implementation requires two main methods:

quickSort(): Selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot element, and recursively sorts the partitioned subarrays.
partition(): Assigns the pivot element and places the pivot element at its right position in the sorted array. Then, it places
all smaller elements to the left of the pivot and places all larger or equal elements to the pivotâ€™s right.
